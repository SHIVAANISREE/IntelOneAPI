# Solar Flares Prediction

* Solar flares are intense bursts of radiation which can disrupt the power grids of a continent, shut down the GPS system or irradiate people exposed in space.
* Developing systems for predicting solar flares would allow us to precisely aim our observation instruments at upcoming events, and eventually enable countermeasures against such worst-case scenarios.

* The prediction of solar flares proves to be a challenging problem, some even compare it to weather forecasting. And regarding Machine Learning, I find this dataset to be particularly challenging because of the complexity of a single sample (up to 40 images), the relatively small size of samples (8'000 for training), and the fact that it is a regression problem.
Intel OneAPI makes it to run faster than other notebooks.

* The purpose of this study is based on the available data, it was estimated numbers of the solar flares production in specific region on sun in the following 24 hours. Accuracy can change due to parameters.
